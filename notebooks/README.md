### Shotgun Proteomics

Analysis of all proteins characterized by mass spectrometer

- [2017-04-12-Demultiplex-Raw-Files.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-04-12-Demultiplex-Raw-Files.ipynb): Separated overlapping m/z windows from mass spectrometry data using MSConvert
- [2017-06-13-Full-Skyline-Preliminary-Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-06-13-Full-Skyline-Preliminary-Analysis.ipynb): Used revised `.blib`to generate usable Skyline data

### Selected Reaction Monitoring

Determination of differential protein expression and evaluation of protein targets as potential biomarkers

- [2017-06-22-Selecting-SRM-Targets-with-MSstats-Part-2.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-06-22-Selecting-SRM-Targets-with-MSstats-Part-2.ipynb): Used MSStats to identify differentially expressed proteins based on site and eelgrass condition.
- [2017-07-05-Examining-Protein-Annotations.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-07-05-Examining-Protein-Annotations.ipynb): Functional analysis to identify targets for SRM analysis
- [2017-07-07-SRM-Target-Identification-in-Skyline.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-07-07-SRM-Target-Identification-in-Skyline.ipynb): Combined protein annotation analysis with MSStats output to refine SRM targets in Skyline


### Irrelevant Analyses

Outputs that were not used further in the pipeline (i.e. failed attempts and dead ends)

- [2017-02-28-DIA-Analysis-PECAN.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-02-28-DIA-Analysis-PECAN.ipynb): Unsuccessful attempt to create `.blib` for downstream Skyline analyses. A large computing capacity was necessary for PECAN. Emma Timmins-Schiffman was able to successfully use DIA data to create a sample-specific `.blib`.
- [2017-03-07-Reconvert-mzML-Files.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-03-07-Reconvert-mzML-Files.ipynb): Reconversion of `RAW` files to `mzML` format. Repeat error of "no usable MS2 data."
- [2017-03-08-Formatting-PECAN-Inputs.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-03-08-Formatting-PECAN-Inputs.ipynb): Formatted PECAN inputs for use. Reformatting was successfulm but attempt to use PECAN was not.
- [2017-03-14-Skyline-Test-Run.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-03-14-Skyline-Test-Run.ipynb): Generated protein area data using previously generated oyster seed `.blib`. 
- [2017-03-21-Preliminary-Proteomic-Data-Analyses.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-03-21-Preliminary-Proteomic-Data-Analyses.ipynb): Proteomic analyses from data generated by oyster seed `.blib`.
- [2017-05-11-Selecting-SRM-Targets.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-05-11-Selecting-SRM-Targets.ipynb): Tried selecting SRM targets using less powerful statistical methods.
- [2017-05-12-Selecting-SRM-Targets-with-MSstats.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/notebooks/DNR/2017-05-12-Selecting-SRM-Targets-with-MSstats.ipynb): First attempt to use MSStats to identify SRM targets before properly formatting data.
