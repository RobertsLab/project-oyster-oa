These images are of O. lurida visceral mass tissue sampled for Laura Spencerâ€™s project.

Each slide contains the tissue of multiple individuals.

Each individual tissue has two images of gonad tissue: one at high magnification (40x) and one at low magnification (4x). 

The images are labeled according to population (example: SN6, HL10, etc), oyster number, and magnification (hi/lo).
