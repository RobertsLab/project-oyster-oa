# Gigas-gonad-histology

*C. gigas* gonad histology images from 2017-02-04 sampling. Oyster samples were collected before exposing individuals to low or ambient pH conditions. Images were taken by Grace Crandall. 

From Grace: 

- Each slide contains multiple individuals. 
- Each individual has two images: one at high magnification (40x) and one at low magnification (4x). 
- The images are labeled as: Gigas _ # _ hi/lo
  - Species: Gigas
  - "#": Oyster ID from [tissue sampling spreadsheet](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/Manchester/2017-Adult-Gigas-Tissue-Sampling/20170204-GigasTissueSamplingInformation.csv)
  - Magnification: "hi" = 40x; "lo" = 4x

Each slide contains multiple individuals. 

Each individual has two images: one at high magnification (40x) and one at low magnification (4x). 

The images are labeled as:
ID_hi/lo

ID is the oyster individual ID created by Yaamini
_hi → high magnification
_lo → low magnification

NOTE: The histology images labeled with individual tissues as “UK-##” are currently not determined which oyster individual they belong to. During the histology process, it appears that the performers of the histology slides moved the tissues into new orientation from what Yaamini’s original key denotes the individual oysters.
