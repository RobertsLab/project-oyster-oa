#### **[2017-02-04 Sampling](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/Manchester/2017-Adult-Gigas-Tissue-Sampling/20170204-GigasTissueSamplingInformation.csv)**:

- Oyster number: Used for animal ID
- Adductuor Tissue Tube ID: A-OysterNumber, tube holds adductor tissue for specific animal
- Ctenida (Gill Tissue) Tube ID: C-OysterNumber, tube holds ctenida tissue for specific animal
- Mantle Tissue Tube ID: M-OysterNumber, tube holds mantle tissue for specific animal
- Ethanol Tube ID: E-OysterNumber, tube holds ctenidia tissue for specific animal in ethanol for DNA analyses
- Gonad Histology Cassette ID: Location of gonad tissue for animal. Cassettes distinguished by number of notches on the side of the cassette (ex. 1 notch, 4 notches)
- Location in Cassette: Cassettes have four quadrants. top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right
- Length: cm, measured using calipers
- Shell and animal weight: g, measured using scale
- Empty shell weight: g, measured using scale
- Calculated animal weight: g, Empty shell weight subtracted from shell and animal weight
- Additional notes

- Number: Used for oyster-ID
- oyster-ID: Number and tank the oyster came from. Six tanks were used, three with low pH conditions (T1, T2 and T3) and three ambient pH conditions (T4, T5 and T6). (ex. Oyster 6 from Tank 1 is 6-T1)
- length: cm, measured using calipers
- shell-and-animal-weight: g, measured using scale
- empty-shell-weight: g, measured using scale
- calculated-biomass: g, empty-shell-weight subtracted from shell-and-animal-weight
- adductor-ID: oysterID-A, tube holds adductor tissue for specific animal
- ctenida-ID: oysterID-C, tube holds ctenida tissue for specific animal
- mantle-ID: oysterID-M, tube holds mantle tissue for specific animal
- ethanol-ID: oysterID-E, tube holds ctenidia tissue for specific animal in ethanol for DNA analyses
- histology-cassette: Location of gonad tissue for animal. Cassettes distinguished by species and a number ID (ex. gigas-1)
- cassette-position: Cassettes have four quadrants. top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right
- notes
