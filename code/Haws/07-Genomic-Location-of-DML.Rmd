In this script, I'll create summary tables for genomic location information, run statistcal tests, and visualize the distribution of DML in the genome.

# Install packages

require(tidyverse)
require(RColorBrewer)

```

# Obtain session information

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

# Establish color scheme

```{r}
plotColors <- brewer.pal(8, "Purples") #Create a color palette for the barplots. Use 5 purple shades from RColorBrewer.
```

# Import data

```{r}
attach("../../project-oyster-oa.Rdata") #Attach R Data if not already loaded
cpgFeatureOverlaps <- cpgFeatureOverlaps
detach("file:../../project-oyster-oa.Rdata")
```

I will look at genomic locations of each condition-specific DML list, then create a plot for visualization.
