In this script, I'll create summary tables for genomic location information, run statistcal tests, and visualize the distribution of DML in the genome.

# Prepare R Markdown file

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "/Users/yaamini/Documents/project-oyster-oa/analyses/Haws_07-DML-characterization/") #Set root directory
```

# Install packages

```{r}
#Packages for visualization

#install.packages("dichromat")
#install.packages("broom")

require(dichromat)
require(broom)
```

# Obtain session information

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

# Establish color scheme

```{r}
plotColors <- rev(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "PuRd")) #Create a color palette for the barplots. Use 5 purple shades from RColorBrewer. Reverse the order so the darkest shade is used first.
```

# Import data

```{r}
#save.image("../../project-gigas-oa-meth.Rdata")
#load("../../project-gigas-oa-meth.Rdata") #Load R Data if not already loaded
```

I will look at genomic locations of each sex-specific DML list, then create a plot for visualization.

## Import file counts

```{r}

cpgFeatureOverlapsploidy <- cpgFeatureOverlapsploidy[c(4, 1, 6, 8, 3, 7, 2, 5),] #Reorganize rows to match order: exon UTR, CDS, intron, upstream, downstream, lncRNA, TE, intergenic
head(cpgFeatureOverlapsploidy) #Confirm import
```

```{r}
cpgFeatureOverlapsploidy$Meth <- cpgFeatureOverlaps$Meth #Add methylated CpG information
rownames(cpgFeatureOverlapsploidy) <- row.names(cpgFeatureOverlaps) #Add rowname information

## Contingency test
