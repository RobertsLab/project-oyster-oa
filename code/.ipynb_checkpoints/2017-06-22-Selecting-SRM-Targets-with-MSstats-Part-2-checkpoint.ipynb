    "The first thing I did was import my data from Skyline into R using `read.csv`. Then I did the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `SkylinetoMSstatsFormat`: Take Skyline report and make it usable within `MSstats`. I used the default settings, which included `UseUniquePeptide = TRUE`. That argument is crucial to using the function `dataProcess`. It may also be useful to use the argument `removeProtein_with1Peptide = TRUE` because a protein needs to have at least two peptides to be used as a target for SRM. I did not use this argument since it was my first time using MSstats but I could use it in the future.\n",
    "2. `dataProcess`: Now that data is usable in MSstats, process it further for pairwise comparison analysis. Again, I used the default settings, which included log transformation using base 2, normalization by medians based on refernece signals, and adding NA for missing peaks.\n",
    "3. Create a contrast matrix: Specify which pairwise comparisons should be examined. Each pairwise comparison had its own row, where a value of -1 or 1 indicated which conditoins should be compared. The rows were then combined into a matrix using `rbind`. \n",
    "4. `groupComparison`: Providing the contrast matrix and processed data, conduct pairwise comparisons for all proteins. I exported the results as a .csv file using `write.csv`.\n",
    "5. `groupComparisonPlots`: `MSstats` has built in ways to visualize the results of pairwise comparisons. The Volcano Plot color-codes proteins based on their differential expression for each pair of conditions compared. The Comparison plot visually compares fold change for each protein across conditions examined. The Heatmap visualizes conditions and proteins at the same time. I produced all of these plots for the three levels of comparison I had, but I didn't find any of them particularly useful."
